**Wikilink shortcuts**: Easily add internal links to Wikimedia wikis (or any other Mediawiki) by simply having the pointer within the word to be linked and pressing **CTRL+]**, or by selecting multiple words, pressing **CTRL+[** and have them linkified according to specific rules (ie, if separated by comma, create different links for each comma-separated chunk of text). This userscript was developed for the needs of [lsj.gr](https://lsj.gr/wiki/Main_Page)
